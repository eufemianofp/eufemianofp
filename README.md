# Hi there, Iâ€™m Eufemiano! ðŸ‘‹

* I'm an experienced data scientist with background in statistics and engineering.
* I'm passionate about applying statistical modelling, machine learning and design of experiments to improve the efficacy and efficiency of systems.
* I'm currently learning about:
  - Causality
  - Python best practices
  - Docker
* I'm excited to collaborate on projects that leverage statistical inference/modelling to better understand a problem, beyond the usage of a ML solution that
  does the predictive modelling part.
* You can reach out to me at eufe.f.p@gmail.com
